#Keras (deeplearning framework)
This is a dockerfile for my own keras-notebook image.
## Keras-notebook is based on jupyter/scipy-notebook.
## I added keras into the distro using pip install keras tensorflow
## So as you see the tensor flow used is only a cpu version, and keras only used tensorflow as the backend in this image.
